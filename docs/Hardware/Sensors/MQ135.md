## Calibration

Environmental sensors are tricky in nature and many have to be calibrated in order to be properly used.
-  Burn in co2 sensor for 24 hours and read rzero after that. [This](https://github.com/Phoenix1747/MQ135b) readme helps. [This tutorial](http://davidegironi.blogspot.com/2014/01/cheap-co2-meter-using-mq135-sensor-with.html#.Y6G9jtLMKA2) as well
-  A [[DHT11]] is used to calculate temperature/humidity compensation
